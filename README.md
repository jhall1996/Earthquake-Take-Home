# Earthquake-Take-Home

Environment Setup: 

You can load the Jupyter Notebook file into a suitable environment, such as a local Jupyter Notebook locally or any other Python IDE that supports Jupyter. I used Google Colab to develop the solution. 
Within Colab, the Python libraries are pre-installed. However, if you are using a different solution you may need to run a pip install.
'pip install pandas matplotlib spacy numpy'  

Data:

The data I used was collected on Friday 9th August from the USGS website via the following link:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/
I selected the data from the past 30 days, saved the results as a CSV and loaded them into this GitHub repository.
